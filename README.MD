# CityBuilder

Management game with RPG mechanics.

## Base idea
Initially, the gameplay to be a management game where the player should be responsible of a small village. Each villager would have its own statistics, class and personnality that influence everything they do.
The player can't directly control the village, instead he'll gives orders like build this here, gather this ressource, craft x times this item. He would also give jobs to villager to decide who do what.

## After ~60 hours of development
Thing kind of game, seemed simple at first but quickly became very complex, the villager's logic especially.
